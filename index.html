                    <p>India had always been known as the land that portrayed cultural and traditional vibrancy through 
                    its conventional arts and crafts. The 35 states and union territories sprawled across the country have their 
                    own distinct cultural and traditional identities, and are displayed through various forms of art prevalent there. 
                    Every region in India has its own style and pattern of art, which is known as folk art. Other than folk art, there 
                    is yet another form of traditional art practiced by several tribes or rural population, which is classified as tribal 
                    art. The folk and tribal arts of India are very ethnic and simple, and yet colorful and vibrant enough to speak volumes 
                    about the country's rich heritage.Folk art in India apparently has a great potential in the international market 
                    because of its traditional aesthetic sensibility and authenticity. The rural folk paintings of India bear 
                    distinctive colorful designs, which are treated with religious and mystical motifs. Some of the most famous 
                    folk paintings of India are the Madhubani paintings of Bihar, Patachitra paintings from the state of Odisha, 
                    the Nirmal paintings of Andhra Pradesh, and other such folk art forms. Folk art is however not restricted only to 
                    paintings, but also stretches to other art forms such as pottery, home decorations, ornaments, cloths-making, and so on. 
                    In fact, the potteries of some of the regions of India are quite popular among foreign tourists because of their ethnic 
                    and traditional beauty.Tribal art, like folk art, has also progressed considerably due to the constant developmental 
                    efforts of the Indian government and other organizations. Tribal art generally reflects the creative energy found 
                    in rural areas that acts as an undercurrent to the craftsmanship of the tribal people. Tribal art ranges through 
                    a wide range of art forms, such as wall paintings, tribal dances, tribal music, and so on
